# Pathfinder-Project

You are free to use and modify the script to your needs. Just give credit and don't claim it to be yours.

I know it isn't likely very optimized but it is quite functional. Use main branch instead of this (dev) branch
because this is likely always going to be broken as I use this branch for saving my in progress work.


Enjoy.
