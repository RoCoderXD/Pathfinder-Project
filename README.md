# Pathfinder-Project INCOMPLETE

You are free to use and modify the script to your needs. Just give credit and don't claim it to be yours.

I know it isn't likely very optimized but it is quite functional. If you are experiencing any problems, please create a new issue:
-> https://github.com/RoCoderXD/Pathfinder-Project/issues (be at least a bit descriptive)


Enjoy.


Loadstring: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoCoderXD/Pathfinder-Project/main/PathfinderProject.lua", true))()

This script has only been tested on S^x (as I make my scripts with it), so if you are using something else just keep in mind that it might not work!


The ability to create and play paths/visualize them are the only currently working features. The next feature to come is saving paths.
