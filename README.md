You are free to use and modify the script to your needs. Just give credit and don't claim it to be yours.

I know it isn't likely very optimized but it is quite functional. If you are experiencing any problems, please create a new issue:
-> https://github.com/RoCoderXD/Pathfinder-Project/issues (be at least a bit descriptive)


Enjoy.
